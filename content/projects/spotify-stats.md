Spotify Stats is a web application powered by Vue, running strictly in the
front-end, who allows the user to find out statistics about their Spotify usage.
It shows the most played tracks and artists in the last three months, and the
most played of all time.

It implements the Spotify API on the front-end, with the OAuth authentication
protocol, which allows the user to have a scoped access to their Spotify data.

You can try the application [live here](https://stats.nezia.dev)!
