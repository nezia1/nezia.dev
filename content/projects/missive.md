Missive is a real-time, end-to-end encrypted chat application implementing the Signal protocol that was built as my 2024's technicien ES diploma's work.

It was implemented using Flutter for the application, as it allows for quick development of cross-platform apps, and Typescript for the server (API and WebSocket server).

You can find the link to the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/nezia1/missive), alongside the [documentation](https://anthony-rdrgz.docs.ictge.ch/missive) that's been written.
