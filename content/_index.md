Iâ€™m Anthony Rodriguez, a French developer currently studying in Switzerland, with a passion for building reproducible systems, crafting web solutions, and discovering new and exciting pieces of software.

Programming having peaked my interest a couple of years back, I decided to study software engineering full-time. Having obtained my technicien ES degree at Centre de Formation Professionnelle et Technique (CFPT) in Geneva, I am now currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science at HEPIA.

During my free-time, I am into music, mainly experimental pop. I also spend a lot of time learning about new ways to automate things, and tinkering around with Linux systems in general.
