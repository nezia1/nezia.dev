I'm Anthony Rodriguez, a French developer studying software engineering in Switzerland. I'm passionate about building reproducible systems and crafting web solutions. After earning my _technicien ES_ degree from Centre de Formation Professionnelle et Technique (CFPT) in Geneva, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science at HEPIA.

My interest in tech sparked a few years ago, and it rapidly evolved into a full-time passion/hobby. I'm particularly passionate about the NixOS ecosystem (which I have been using extensively since early 2025), as well as anything Linux in general. Free open-source software being extremely important and valuable to me, I've been contributing to a few projects that I use on a daily basis.

Currently, I am working on [hjem-rum](https://github.com/snugnug/hjem-rum) (a collection of modules for [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem), a [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) alternative).
