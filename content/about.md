Iâ€™m Anthony Rodriguez, a French developer currently studying in Switzerland. I like to build things for the web, software related things in general, and I love learning about new and interesting technologies.

Programming having peaked my interest a couple of years back, I decided to study software development full-time. Having obtained my technicien ES degree at Centre de Formation Professionnelle et Technique (CFPT) in Geneva, I am now currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science at HEPIA.

During my free-time, I am an avid music enthusiast, and I enjoy learning about game design.
